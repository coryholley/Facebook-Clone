# Facebook-Clone
Create a Facebook clone. It should have the following features:

User Profiles - (including new user registration) with a featured image/avatar.
Image Galleries - to allow users to show off their photos.
Friends - Users should be able to friend each other, and display a list of their friends.
Friends of your friends should be able to see your friend list, but others should not.
Groups - Users should be able to join groups, create pages which display information on their group—including a Google Map with their location—and allow only other registered users to join the group.
User Homepages - should display their info, along with their friends, groups, and a few recent images.
Status Updates - users should be able to post new statuses.
Comments - users should be able to comment on their friends statuses.
eMail Updates - users should be able to toggle eMail notifications for events; like new friend requests, comments on their statuses, etc.
The scope of this project makes it ideal for working in a team.
